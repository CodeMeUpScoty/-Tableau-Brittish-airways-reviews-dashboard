British Airways Customer Reviews &amp; Sentiment Analysis (Tableau)

Project Overview

This project focused on analyzing British Airways customer review data to evaluate passenger satisfaction, service quality, and overall brand perception. Using Tableau, I developed an interactive dashboard that enables stakeholders to explore customer sentiment across multiple service dimensions and identify patterns impacting customer experience.
The objective was to convert unstructured customer feedback and rating data into actionable insights that support service improvement, operational decision-making, and customer-centric strategy.
